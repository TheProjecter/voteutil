<h1>Election Methods in C++</h1>
<p>There are two libraries with separate implementations of election methods.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="static_candidates/index.html">static_candidates/</a> contains implementations which requires a static ballot without write-ins. Some constant number of candidates is referred to by index.</li>
<li>dynamic_candidates/ contains implementations which allow write-ins and require no knowledge of the ballot before they start counting. Each vote is a set of name=value pairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, the native input to election methods is a rating for each choice, and utility functions exist to parse text input and convert rankings (1st,2nd,3rd,...) to ratings.</p>
